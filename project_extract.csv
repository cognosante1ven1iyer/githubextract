WebOps is hosted on Azure Stack on-prem; so they want to migrate to VAEC Azure.  It is not an emergency – so starting the planning on this and putting the actual migration in Wave 5 or 6 would be ok.  Let’s get it in sync with the new 12 They will need:  1.	A EDE Azure Labs form and provisioning – so they can start working in Azure ASAP to get familiar 2.	A VAEC-Azure provisioning sheet – for the actual migration – they can work this while we work the next steps… 3.	A VIPR created and fast tracked to ECSO since decision mad 4.	A CSP evaluation done for the file documenting Azure choice 5.	Cost analysis and we’ll have to work funding out with Tom Phillips 6.	Sync up putting this in Cloud Key/VLMF 12 step process and advancing it to the correct step to start working with the WebOps team. 7.	Assign a ECSO Azure concierge  8.	Provision the resource groups in Azure so if we identify any easy storage only wins we’ll work that early as part of our work with the ITC and can put it in the right place …  9.	Then work it through the VLMF process like any other migration   As a side note: This could be a great way to test Azure Site Recovery for the migration as well  Sue/Will – per the above this will be a migration project – let’s start working it as a normal project and Will only treat any low hanging fruit storage opportunities as something we would do right away.

Azure labs does not support Cognitive Services or Machine Learning Service; key components to the project infrastructure. 2.	 Azure labs obscures the true interface an end-user would use if the project was deployed. I want to be sure I have exposure to the native Gov Cloud interface to understand our current limitations and opportunities. 3.	Azure labs does not afford access to GPU compute out of the box; adding another challenge and potential project delay.  Effectively; to bring this project to fruition; I need access to much of Azure's cutting edge services. I understand the need for security and cost-containment. We could leverage Azure Active Directory to constrain access and set budget limits. If speaking over the phone or web meeting would clarify things; please let me know.

WebOps is hosted on Azure Stack on-prem; so they want to migrate to VAEC Azure.  It is not an emergency – so starting the planning on this and putting the actual migration in Wave 5 or 6 would be ok.  Let’s get it in sync with the new 12 They will need:  1.	A EDE Azure Labs form and provisioning – so they can start working in Azure ASAP to get familiar 2.	A VAEC-Azure provisioning sheet – for the actual migration – they can work this while we work the next steps… 3.	A VIPR created and fast tracked to ECSO since decision mad 4.	A CSP evaluation done for the file documenting Azure choice 5.	Cost analysis and we’ll have to work funding out with Tom Phillips 6.	Sync up putting this in Cloud Key/VLMF 12 step process and advancing it to the correct step to start working with the WebOps team. 7.	Assign a ECSO Azure concierge  8.	Provision the resource groups in Azure so if we identify any easy storage only wins we’ll work that early as part of our work with the ITC and can put it in the right place …  9.	Then work it through the VLMF process like any other migration   As a side note: This could be a great way to test Azure Site Recovery for the migration as well  Sue/Will – per the above this will be a migration project – let’s start working it as a normal project and Will only treat any low hanging fruit storage opportunities as something we would do right away.

Azure labs does not support Cognitive Services or Machine Learning Service; key components to the project infrastructure. 2.	 Azure labs obscures the true interface an end-user would use if the project was deployed. I want to be sure I have exposure to the native Gov Cloud interface to understand our current limitations and opportunities. 3.	Azure labs does not afford access to GPU compute out of the box; adding another challenge and potential project delay.  Effectively; to bring this project to fruition; I need access to much of Azure's cutting edge services. I understand the need for security and cost-containment. We could leverage Azure Active Directory to constrain access and set budget limits. If speaking over the phone or web meeting would clarify things; please let me know.

WebOps is hosted on Azure Stack on-prem; so they want to migrate to VAEC Azure.  It is not an emergency – so starting the planning on this and putting the actual migration in Wave 5 or 6 would be ok.  Let’s get it in sync with the new 12 They will need:  1.	A EDE Azure Labs form and provisioning – so they can start working in Azure ASAP to get familiar 2.	A VAEC-Azure provisioning sheet – for the actual migration – they can work this while we work the next steps… 3.	A VIPR created and fast tracked to ECSO since decision mad 4.	A CSP evaluation done for the file documenting Azure choice 5.	Cost analysis and we’ll have to work funding out with Tom Phillips 6.	Sync up putting this in Cloud Key/VLMF 12 step process and advancing it to the correct step to start working with the WebOps team. 7.	Assign a ECSO Azure concierge  8.	Provision the resource groups in Azure so if we identify any easy storage only wins we’ll work that early as part of our work with the ITC and can put it in the right place …  9.	Then work it through the VLMF process like any other migration   As a side note: This could be a great way to test Azure Site Recovery for the migration as well  Sue/Will – per the above this will be a migration project – let’s start working it as a normal project and Will only treat any low hanging fruit storage opportunities as something we would do right away.

Azure labs does not support Cognitive Services or Machine Learning Service; key components to the project infrastructure. 2.	 Azure labs obscures the true interface an end-user would use if the project was deployed. I want to be sure I have exposure to the native Gov Cloud interface to understand our current limitations and opportunities. 3.	Azure labs does not afford access to GPU compute out of the box; adding another challenge and potential project delay.  Effectively; to bring this project to fruition; I need access to much of Azure's cutting edge services. I understand the need for security and cost-containment. We could leverage Azure Active Directory to constrain access and set budget limits. If speaking over the phone or web meeting would clarify things; please let me know.

Sync up putting this in Cloud Key/VLMF 12 step process and advancing it to the correct step to start working with the WebOps team. 7.	Assign a ECSO Azure concierge  8.	Provision the resource groups in Azure so if we identify any easy storage only wins we’ll work that early as part of our work with the ITC and can put it in the right place …  9.

Project,2060978,"Azure Migration Projects",4123641,"Provisioned (VLMF Step 6)",Incident,74,Artificial Intelligence Proof of Concept Station-David - ideally it will not be an azure labs environment for the following reasons:  1.	 Azure labs does not support Cognitive Services or Machine Learning Service; key components to the project infrastructure. 2.	 Azure labs obscures the true interface an end-user would use if the project was deployed. I want to be sure I have exposure to the native Gov Cloud interface to understand our current limitations and opportunities. 3.	Azure labs does not afford access to GPU compute out of the box; adding another challenge and potential project delay.  Effectively; to bring this project to fruition; I need access to much of Azure's cutting edge services. I understand the need for security and cost-containment. We could leverage Azure Active Directory to constrain access and set budget limits. If speaking over the phone or web meeting would clarify things; please let me know.
